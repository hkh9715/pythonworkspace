1
00:00:02,284 --> 00:00:03,660
When in Korea, it's best to have

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,494
a guide who really knows the country.

3
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:07,126
Fortunately, I have such a friend.

4
00:00:07,126 --> 00:00:09,931
Steven Yeun, we've been naked together,

5
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:12,651
and as close as two men can be.

6
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:14,187
Yeah.

7
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:17,483
I'm excited to show you the country.

8
00:00:17,483 --> 00:00:19,083
Maybe...

9
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,540
(speaking in Korean)

10
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,124
(audience laughs)

11
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:25,300
They're thrilled we're here, just thrilled.

12
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,560
Let's go.

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,157
(Korean instrumental music)

14
00:00:30,747 --> 00:00:32,612
Oh my god.

15
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:34,820
Oh my god, oh my god.

16
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,796
(yelling)

17
00:00:37,796 --> 00:00:39,342
Nooo!

18
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:40,730
No!

19
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,730
Hold on.

20
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,430
No, why did it do that?

21
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,201
It let it go on purpose.

22
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,726
Hold on, we got another one. Why?

23
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:48,910
Why?

24
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,056
Come on, come on.

25
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:53,056
No!

26
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:55,256
No! (thumping)

27
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:02,424
Yeah!

28
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:05,207
(audience cheering)

29
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:08,156
Yaaay.

30
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:13,966
I am now about to enjoy a traditional Korean meal.

31
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:16,653
Steven, can you tell me what these dishes are?

32
00:01:16,653 --> 00:01:19,255
Um, yes.

33
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:20,855
You don't seem to know.

34
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:21,954
Do you know what this is?

35
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:23,063
What's that for example?

36
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:25,378
I mean, I've seen it, that's uh...

37
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:26,572
Seriously, you have no idea?

38
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:28,311
So it looks like rice.

39
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:30,053
Yeah?

40
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:30,975
(uncertain groan)

41
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:32,929
You're my cultural ambassador.

42
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:34,269
What are you doing? I just eat it.

43
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:35,418
No, listen I'm Irish--

44
00:01:35,418 --> 00:01:36,492
That's potato salad.

45
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:37,740
Yes, I know potato salad.

46
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,998
Yeah, that's good.

47
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,761
This was a Jewish delicatessen about 15 minutes ago.

48
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,297
Those look like pancakes of some kind.

49
00:01:43,297 --> 00:01:45,393
Yes, yes, Korean pancakes, pajeon.

50
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:46,635
Pajeon?

51
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:50,240
Yup, has whatever my mom puts in it, I dunno.

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,094
I just eat it.

53
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,832
And then that is...

54
00:01:52,832 --> 00:01:56,576
Fish cakes?

55
00:01:56,576 --> 00:01:58,528
Why'd your voice get so high?

56
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,309
Uncertainty.

57
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:01,333
(laughter)

58
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,261
Is this a soup?

59
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:05,023
This is kimchi gungmul, or byul kimchi,

60
00:02:05,023 --> 00:02:06,399
or one of those things,

61
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,394
which is essentially kimchi water.

62
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:09,759
Right.

63
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,316
You're sort of like Anthony Bourdain,

64
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:13,663
if he knew absolutely nothing.

65
00:02:13,663 --> 00:02:16,052
This is you.

66
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,399
I believe this a spoon of some?

67
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,052
Maybe a spoon, maybe a fork?

68
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:21,417
It could be a knife?

69
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,646
Okay, let's not talk about the food you know nothing about.

70
00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:26,313
We will eat the food he knows nothing about.

71
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,042
Try like this.

72
00:02:28,042 --> 00:02:29,075
Oh, with spoon.

73
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:30,291
No that's...

74
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:32,243
not how you use...

75
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:33,747
Don't I have to use...

76
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:35,485
No, you can use your hand.

77
00:02:35,485 --> 00:02:38,573
This is counter-intuitive to most...

78
00:02:41,437 --> 00:02:43,688
You sort of...

79
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:45,192
(slurping)

80
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:47,436
(audience cheering)

81
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:54,855
You lose, I win.

82
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:56,199
Our ways are different,

83
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,919
but who's to say which one is better?

84
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,757
Me. Yeah, that's a better way.
