1
00:00:02,405 --> 00:00:04,187
Current tensions between South Korea

2
00:00:04,187 --> 00:00:07,184
and North Korea are higher than they've been in years.

3
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:09,926
These hostilities continued for a simple reason,

4
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:12,059
the Korean War never ended.

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:14,246
When combat stopped in 1953,

6
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:16,080
no peace treaty was ever signed.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,768
Just a ceasefire, which continues to this day,

8
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,763
leaving the two countries separated by the

9
00:00:20,763 --> 00:00:23,920
D-M-Z, or Demilitarized Zone, filled with

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,272
high voltage fence and over one million land mines.

11
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:31,312
And along this no man's land, there is just one point

12
00:00:31,312 --> 00:00:34,021
where these enemies can stand face to face,

13
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:36,605
the JSA or Joint Security Area.

14
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:39,981
Here the border between North and South Korea

15
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:43,160
runs along a concrete curb and bisects

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,837
blue conference rooms where the two sides have

17
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,744
occasionally met for diplomatic talks.

18
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:51,304
The JSA has more often been the sight of

19
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:54,131
hundreds of acts of violence and provocations.

20
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:56,061
Given this situation I could think of no

21
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:58,781
two better people to visit the JSA than

22
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:01,896
Conan O'Brien and Steven Yeun.

23
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:03,165
(laughter)

24
00:01:03,165 --> 00:01:05,608
Well, we are in the DMZ.

25
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:06,941
This is surreal.

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,416
That is North Korea right there, those

27
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,848
are North Koreans staring back at us.

28
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:13,181
He's probably freaking out because he

29
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:14,162
recognizes both of us.

30
00:01:14,162 --> 00:01:17,832
He's a huge Walking Dead and Team Coco fan.

31
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:19,368
That's Bob, we named him Bob,

32
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:21,085
they do 12 hour shifts.

33
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:23,198
Does the guy change, but the name stays the same?

34
00:01:23,198 --> 00:01:24,754
We don't know their names,

35
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:25,746
we just call them Bob.

36
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:28,306
That guy is shoveling, shoveling.

37
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:31,026
[Steven} Shoveling Lies.

38
00:01:31,026 --> 00:01:32,296
Can I say you're the best dressed soldier

39
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:34,504
I have even seen in my life.

40
00:01:34,504 --> 00:01:37,480
Like a Janet Jackson backup dancer, incredible.

41
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,386
(laughter)

42
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:39,401
He looks amazing.

43
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:40,658
Let me explain what's happening here.

44
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:42,728
We're now in a room and we've been told

45
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,470
that when we cross past this table

46
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,456
we will be in North Korea.

47
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:51,848
Why does this historically significant building

48
00:01:51,848 --> 00:01:54,706
that links these two separated countries,

49
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:57,425
look so much like the business center of a Ramada Inn?

50
00:01:57,425 --> 00:01:58,258
(laughter)

51
00:01:58,258 --> 00:01:59,750
Sir, you do realize you're wearing sunglasses

52
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,553
indoors in a snowstorm.

53
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:04,369
Other people are doing it as well.

54
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,225
Okay, I guess if I jumped off a bridge

55
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:07,430
you would as well.

56
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,337
(laughter)

57
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:10,268
Sorry, this is probably not the time or the place

58
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:11,633
for my quips.

59
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:12,466
You are in North Korea.

60
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,300
I am in North Korea.

61
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,791
I am still in South Korea.

62
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,050
Oh, congratulations.

63
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,883
(Laughter)

64
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,253
North Korea and is this gentleman with us?

65
00:02:20,253 --> 00:02:21,222
Yes.

66
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:23,569
Do not touch him, or cross behind him

67
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,918
because if you touch him I can't help you after that.

68
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:29,309
What are you talking about?

69
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:31,164
So I will not touch this man

70
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:32,444
And do not go behind.

71
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,457
This is crazy.

72
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,366
We have just been told not to touch this man

73
00:02:35,366 --> 00:02:36,902
or go behind him,

74
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:38,705
which is usually my rule with any man.

75
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:39,538
(laughter)

76
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:44,345
All right, we're here, we're in North Korea.

77
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,944
(cheering)

78
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,876
I'm here at my desk with Steven Yeun

79
00:03:14,876 --> 00:03:16,376
from Walking Dead.

80
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:19,980
So how's your life going?

81
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,209
It's going, going pretty good, I'm getting married.

82
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,042
You're getting married.

83
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:23,876
Yes.

84
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:24,709
That's fantastic.

85
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:25,542
Thank you.

86
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:26,376
(cheering)

87
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:30,301
Did you hear that, he's getting married?

88
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,306
So are you excited about the new season of Walking Dead?

89
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:36,607
Yeah, it's, we've worked really hard on it.

90
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:37,514
I'm told you have a clip.

91
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:38,347
Yes.

92
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:43,028
(screaming)

93
00:03:44,437 --> 00:03:46,362
Does North Korea know that we are here right now?

94
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,195
Yes

95
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:50,662
There is a video so they can watch what is happening here

96
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:53,312
So North Korean officials are watching us right now?

97
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:55,989
I guess you are not famous in North Korea.

98
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,056
(laughter)

99
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,005
What the hell are you talking about?

100
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:58,839
He's famous.

101
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,533
I'm huge in North Korea.

102
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,144
I played there last year.

103
00:04:02,144 --> 00:04:03,144
(laughing)

104
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,381
Two minutes, okay.

105
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:10,912
We've been obviously kidding around a little bit.

106
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:13,931
But this is a serious thing.

107
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:17,025
The idea that you and I could be in North Korea talking

108
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:20,502
and communicating freely seems like

109
00:04:20,502 --> 00:04:22,432
kind of a cool message.

110
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,640
Honestly, I never would have ever,

111
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,942
thought I could do this.

112
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:29,867
This is the dream, the dream is to unify.

113
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:32,043
The dream is to bring families and

114
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:35,126
people together, and that's the hope.

115
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:40,683
It's so surreal that this separation

116
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:44,192
is completely man-made and ridiculous.

117
00:04:44,192 --> 00:04:46,442
So let's hope that changes.

118
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,715
Hey this is Conan O'Brien.

119
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:56,931
I'm reporting from North Korea with the weather.

120
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,931
It is cloudy, overcast,

121
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:04,327
light snow showers, about 28 degrees.

122
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:07,525
Here now with the weather from South Korea, Steven Yeun.

123
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:08,623
Steven.

124
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,106
Hey thank you Conan.

125
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:10,939
(laughter)

126
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:14,565
I'm here in South Korea with the weather report.

127
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,610
It's the same.

128
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,443
(laughter)

129
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:19,909
We're going to throw up a commercial now.

130
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,250
This whole segment has been sponsored by Indoor Sunglasses.

131
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,338
(laughter)

132
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:27,567
Worn by everyone in the DMZ.

133
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:28,401
(cheering)
